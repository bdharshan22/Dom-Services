# ðŸš€ Production Environment Setup

## Backend Environment Variables (Render)

Make sure these environment variables are set in your Render dashboard:

```env
# Database
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://dharshancgm2005_db_user:CSoaoyEFftElB0A2@domestic-services.7xoi7co.mongodb.net/domestic-services?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Domestic-services

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production

# Razorpay
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_RF9TeS5siUSKeC
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=wZpulGFin1xou4u0MqHEo0jP

# Email Configuration (CRITICAL FOR EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS)
EMAIL_USER=dharshancgm2005@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=zdur ckqr fgzf beum

# Server
PORT=4000
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Frontend Environment Variables (Vercel)

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://dom-services.onrender.com/api
```

## Performance Optimizations Applied:

1. **Immediate Response**: Payment verification now responds immediately after booking creation
2. **Async Email**: Email notifications are sent asynchronously without blocking the response
3. **Reduced Logging**: Minimized console logs in production for better performance
4. **Faster Modal**: Payment success modal shows instantly without delays

## Email Service Status:

- âœ… Gmail SMTP configured with app password
- âœ… Email credentials properly set in environment
- âœ… Async email sending to prevent blocking
- âœ… Fallback logging if email fails

## Testing Checklist:

1. **Payment Flow**:
   - [ ] Payment modal opens quickly
   - [ ] Payment processes without delays
   - [ ] Success modal appears immediately (within 0.5s)
   - [ ] Auto-redirect works after 1 second

2. **Email Notifications**:
   - [ ] Check Render logs for email status
   - [ ] Verify email credentials in environment
   - [ ] Test with different email addresses
   - [ ] Check spam folder if not received

## Troubleshooting:

If emails are still not working:
1. Check Render environment variables
2. Verify Gmail app password is correct
3. Check Render logs for email errors
4. Ensure EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS are set correctly
